            Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind, water,
            and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.

            The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries and
            perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.

                We believe science should not be confined to textbooks, but brought to life through exhibits. This is
                why
                we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore.
                Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life
                (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home). Hover over the names for a cool effect!

                Energetica Exhibition on Loan </h3>
              <p class="bg-secondary-3 fs-l">
                On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community
                Science Museum. It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
                elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how
                turbines are able to use and control wind to create power.
